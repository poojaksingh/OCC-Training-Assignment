            <dt>Dear Eileen</dt>
            <p>Thankyou for your recent application to join us at the University of awesome science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr>next year.I will answer your question one by one,in the following sections.</p>
            <h3><strong>Starting Dates</strong></h3>
            <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;the start date of each one are as follows:</p>
            <ul>

              <h3><strong>Subjects of study</strong></h3>
              <p>At the Awesome science Faculty we have pretty open minded reasearch facility- as long as subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.Saying that of the ideas you submmitted we are most intrigued by are as follows in order of priority:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and health benefits of Resveratron (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassPlayers at temperatures exceeding 30<span> &#8451; </span>(86 <span>&#x2109;</span>),when the audience size exponentiually increases (effect of 3 <span>&times;</span> 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 <span>&times;</span> 10<sup>4</sup>.) </li>
                <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
              </ol> 
              <dt>so Please can you provide more information on each of the subject,including how long you'd expect the reasearch to take ,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.</dt>
             
              <h2><strong>Exotic Dance Moves</strong></h2>
              <p>Yes,your are right!As part of my post-doctorate,I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,my favourite dnaces are as follows,with definations: </p>
              <dl>Ploynesian chicken dance</dl>
              <blockquote>A little know but <i>very</i> infuentail dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole viallage would  dnace around in cirlce like chickens , to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</blockquote>
              <dl>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dl>
              <blockquote>Before the Icelandersdeveloped the fire as means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,which  involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say thta he thought this dance inpired modern styles such as Twerking. </blockquote>
              <dl>Arctic robot dance</dl>
              <blockquote>An interesting eaxample of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants of the northen Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this  beacause they were rellay cold.</blockquote>
              <dl>For More of my reasearch,see my <a href="https:www.w3schools.com">exotic dance research page.</a></dl>
              <dl>Yours sincerely,</dl>
